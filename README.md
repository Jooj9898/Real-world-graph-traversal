ðŸ“Š Graph Traversal and Pathfinding Algorithms in Java

This project provides a simple implementation of a weighted undirected graph using adjacency linked lists, designed to efficiently handle sparse graphs. It includes several classic graph algorithms written in Java:

âœ… Features
  -Graph Representation: Adjacency linked lists for efficient storage
  -Depth-First Search (DFS): Recursive implementation with discovery and finish times
  -Breadth-First Search (BFS): Queue-based traversal with edge tracking
  -Prim's Algorithm: For computing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
  -Dijkstra's Algorithm: For computing the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) from a single source

  The PDF Includes a detailed report on the entire process, the time complexity of the code, any errors found along the way and diagrams representing the graph traversal

  Real world example:
  -I tested Dijkstras algorithm on the roadmap of the city of Rome and Berlin, and successfully found the Minimum Spanning Tree around the entire city in seconds.
